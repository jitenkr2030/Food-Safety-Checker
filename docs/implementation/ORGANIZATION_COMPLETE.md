2. **Voice Commands** - "Check this food safety" functionality
3. **Real-time Video Analysis** - Live camera feed analysis
4. **Web Dashboard** - Admin interface for restaurant owners
5. **Smart Notifications** - Expiry alerts and safety changes

### 3. Technical Implementation Path
```
Phase 1: Core UX Improvements
├── Offline ML models for mobile
├── Voice command integration
├── Video analysis pipeline
└── Enhanced notification system

Phase 2: Platform Expansion  
├── Web dashboard development

```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# For new features:
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Develop in appropriate directory (mobile-app/src/, backend/src/, etc.)
3. Add tests in tests/ directory
4. Update documentation in docs/
5. Create pull request for review
```

### 2. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Test structure:
tests/
├── backend/          # API and server tests
├── ml-models/        # Model accuracy and performance tests  
├── mobile-app/       # UI and integration tests
└── integration/      # End-to-end workflow tests
```

### 3. Deployment Pipeline
```bash
# Infrastructure ready:
infrastructure/
├── docker/           # Container configurations
├── k8s/              # Kubernetes deployment configs
└── scripts/          # Automated deployment scripts
```
